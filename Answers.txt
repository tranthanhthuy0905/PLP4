- Does your language include multiple types of loops (while, do/while, for, foreach)? If so, what are they and how do they differ from each other?
C++ has while loop, for loop and do...while, similar to Java 

- What is the syntax for declaring a function in your language?
SYNTAX: returnDataType functionName(parameters?) {}

- Are there any rules about where the function has to be placed in your code file so that it can run?
Child functions should be placed or declared before main()

- Does your language support recursive functions?
C++ supports recursion similar to Java and Python

- Can functions in your language accept multiple parameters? Can they be of different data types?
C++ accepts multiple parameters and they can be different types

- Can functions in your language return multiple values at the same time? How is that implemented?  If not, are there ways around that problem?  What are they?
C++ does not officially accept returning multiple values but gathering returns into tuple, struct, ... 

- Is your language pass-by reference or value? Check your code against outside sources in case there is anything tricky going on (like in Perl).
C++ both passes by reference and value

- Are there any other aspects of functions in your language that aren't specifically asked about here, but that are important to know in order to write one? What are they?
Mostly I cannot see void function in C++.
