Assignment 4: Loops and functions              Due: April 11, 2022

 

Being able to repeat code through loops and functions (which can be called more than once and sent different information each time) is a huge part of most programming languages.  However, different programming languages have different kinds of loops, and there are a lot of variations in how functions are declared, where they have to be put, how they accept parameters, and how the function output is returned.  In your programming language, do the following (or explain why it can’t be done as described):

 

1. Write (or try to emulate, if your language doesn’t have them) different kinds of loops: while, do/while, for, foreach
2. Write a function that takes in two numbers, multiplies them, and returns the output
3. Write a recursive function (one that calculates a factorial is fine)
4. Write a function that takes in a string (or your language's equivalent) and splits it into two strings, then returns both strings
5. Call your functions and save the results of the function calls in variables.
6. Write a function that tests whether your language is pass-by-reference or pass-by-value.
 

For your write-up, address the following items:

- Does your language include multiple types of loops (while, do/while, for, foreach)? If so, what are they and how do they differ from each other?
What is the syntax for declaring a function in your language?
- Are there any rules about where the function has to be placed in your code file so that it can run?
- Does your language support recursive functions?
- Can functions in your language accept multiple parameters? Can they be of different data types?
- Can functions in your language return multiple values at the same time? How is that implemented?  If not, are there ways around that problem?  What are they?
- Is your language pass-by reference or value? Check your code against outside sources in case there is anything tricky going on (like in Perl).
- Are there any other aspects of functions in your language that aren't specifically asked about here, but that are important to know in order to write one? What are they?
 

If your language doesn't support anything like this, then explain why not and what it does instead (feel free to check in with me on this if you aren't sure what your language does).

 

As always, write out the answers to these questions as though you were writing a guide for a new learner.  Make your answers as clear as possible, and don't just answer the questions in one or two words.  Explain the reasoning behind the answers as much as possible.  If there is no clear-cut answer to a question, explain why not.  And cite your sources! 

 

Turn in both your code and your written answers, and be prepared to run your code for me in lab.
